# üëü Text-to-Image Shoe Generator

This project uses a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model to generate unique and high-quality shoe designs from text prompts.

## üîç What It Does

-   **Generates Shoe Images**: Creates photorealistic or stylized shoe images based on user descriptions.
-   **Customizable Output**: Allows users to control generation parameters like guidance scale and inference steps.
-   **Fine-Tuned Model**: Built on Stable Diffusion, fine-tuned specifically on a dataset of shoe images for specialized results.
-   **Interactive UI**: Features a simple and intuitive web interface built with Gradio.
